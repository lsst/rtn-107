\setDocAbstract{%
We describe the activities of the Target-of-Opportunity mock data challenge, taking place from Sep 22 2025 - Oct 18 2025. We center this activity in four questions that are critical for maximizing the scientific output of the ToO system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How quickly can Rubin Observatory start observing after a ToO alert is received?
    \item How efficient is Rubin Observatory at recovering the host of a ToO event?
    \item How accurate are the observing strategies that the community has created for the ToO program?
    \item How can expert ToO scientists interact effectively with the ToO system, where many processes are fully automated?
\end{itemize}
In this challenge, and the report summarized herein, we aim to answer the aforementioned questions to better the Rubin ToO program.
